SlideShow Program

Displays the .JPG files in the selected directory and all its subdirectories in the order in which they are listed in File 
Explorer.

On startup, select the directory that contains the files to be displayed.

The Auto button opens a window to choose the wait time (seconds) for each displayed slide.  Once Auto is running, it changes to Pause to stop the Auto function, or Resume to resume it. 

The Prev button and the Left Key interrupt the Auto function, and display the previous slide. Resume turns the Auto function back on at normal size.  

The Next button and the Right Key display the next slide.  The Auto function remains on.

The Pause button interrupts the Auto function.  It can be turned back on by Resume.

The Expand and Shrink buttons interrupt the Auto function, but it can be turned back on at normal size with Resume.  They also turn on the Left/Right/Up/Down buttons. 

The order of the slides is determined by the alphabetical order in Windows File Explorer.  You can change the order by editing the file name, e.g., by adding a sequential number in front of the file names.

If you encounter any problem please let me know, preferably with the picture files that produced them, so that I can try to modify the code to deal with the circumstance.
